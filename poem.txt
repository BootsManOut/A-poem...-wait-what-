Once upon a bool, there was a bug.
And all day long he went buggedibuggedibug!
And it was horrible!

So he said he wanted travel far away, into the lands of Kivy, or the beautiful seas of Java! Stories have it the loop fish there have been enchanting
people with their beautiful colors while swimming for as long as time goes. If you would only stare them in their eyes for too long!

So bug decided to travel to Java. He had a hell of a time!
He made many friends, and after a month he had traveled all over Java with his best buddies Kles, Zeus and Slammer.

While drinking in a party bar in Jakarta, they met Ms Corona for the first time.
They couldn't help but bully and tease her the whole time.
She just wasn't of their kind. And everyone felt sick around her. There was just something about her energy and aura...

But after a year abroad, bug started to feel nostalgic, and he remembered his good old days on his worm farm.

He had seen the world, he had done what his heart desired, it was time to go home.

To this day, Bug still lives with his wife and 3 kids in a city near Kivy, raising and cultivating the rare Daprosy worms on his farm.
